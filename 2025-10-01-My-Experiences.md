Before coming to the University of Connecticut, I studied at Bethel High School in Bethel, CT.
There, I had many experiences relating to science and related fields:

* I was a member of the Science National Honor Society (SNHS) for two years.
* I was a member of the local math honor society for one year.
* As part of a senior "Capstone" project, I designed a display about sorting algorithms and time complexity to present at the school's STEM fair.
* During my time there, I gained experience with programming languages including python and javascript.

These experiences have impacted my future trajectory, inluding the time I have spent in college.
